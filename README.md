# odin-landing-page

Basic HTML and CSS project, with minimum CSS styling and focusing on the concepts learned instead (just copied the exact design png image). Might be overusing flexbox for everything. Some hard coded width/heights despite using flexbox to imitate the design, which may not be ideal. Nevertheless the design is replicated (at the very least on my screen).
